            <h2>Color</h2>              
            <p>To create a really vibrant painting, you need to plan which colors to use. If you try to reproduce all the colors 
                       you see in front of you, they end up vying with each other, a bit like all the instruments in an orchestra playing at once. If, on the other hand, you try limiting the colors you use in a painting to complementary opposites, such as red and green, you will find that the colors make each other appear more vibrant. The reds will 
                       look much more red and the greens will appear more intensely green.
                    </p>

        <h2>Color Wheel</h2>
        <p>The color wheel is a classic device that shows how the six main colors - red, purple, blue, orange, 
            green, and yellow - relate to one another. The color wheel contains the three primary colors and three 
            secondary colors. Primary colors - red, yellow, and blue -  cannot be mixed from any other colors. 
            Secondary colors - orange, purple, and green - are mixed from two primary colors. The colors between 
            the primary and secondary colors on the wheel are known as intermediate colors.</p>

        <h2>Color Mixing</h2>
        <p>
            It is easy to mix watercolor paints to make new colors, both in a palette and on paper. The recommended 
            basic palette of ten colors includes the three primary colors, green, and browns, so you will be able to mix a 
            wide range of colors. There are several shades of some colors; for example, there are two reds: cadmium red 
            and the bluer alizarin crimson. The different shades of a color react differently when mixed with other colors, 
            increasing the range of colors you can create.</p>
<hr />
        <h2>Light and Dark</h2>
        <p>
            Tone - the relative lightness or darkness of colors - is the most important building block for all painting. It 
            creates pattern and shape, movement and design. Color, depth, and focus are all diminished without good, 
            clear use of tone. A painting in which all the colors are of a similar tone looks dull because there are no high 
            notes or low notes - nothing stands out. To create subtle paintings full of energy and interest, it is best to limit 
            the colors you choose and to use neutrals to create a varied range and depth of tone.</p>
